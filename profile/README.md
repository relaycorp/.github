We're Relaycorp, the makers of [Awala](https://awala.network), [Letro](https://letro.app/en/) and [VeraId](https://vera.domains/).

## Project organisation and conventions

- Projects available in multiple platforms or languages have a suffix denoting the platform/language. Examples include `-android` vs `-desktop`, and `-js` vs `-jvm`.
- Cloud infrastructure projects start with `cloud-`.
